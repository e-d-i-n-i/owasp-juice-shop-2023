# Meta Geo Stalking Challenge üåç

## Objective

The goal of this challenge is to expose sensitive data through open source information gathering. You will use EXIF data from an image to identify a location and answer a security question to reset a password.

## Instructions

1. **Locate the Username**: The username for the account you need to access is `john@juice-sh.op`.

2. **Find the Security Question**: The security question for resetting John's password is: "What's your favourite place to go hiding?"

3. **Download the Image**:

   - Navigate to the **Photo Wall** page.
   - Locate and download an image posted by John.

4. **Extract EXIF Data**:

   - Open a terminal on Kali Linux (or your preferred OS).
   - Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the image.
   - Run the following command to extract EXIF data:
     ```bash
     exiftool favourite-hiking-place.png
     ```
   - This command will reveal GPS coordinates embedded in the image.

5. **Identify the Location**:

   - Use the extracted GPS coordinates to identify the location. You can use Google Maps or AI tools like GPT or Gemini for this purpose.
   - The coordinates `36¬∞57'31.4"N 84¬∞20'53.6"W` will lead you to "Scuttlehole Trailhead."

6. **Attempt Password Reset**:

   - Go to the **Forgot Password** page.
   - Answer the security question with "Scuttlehole Trailhead."
   - Choose a new password (e.g., "12345") and submit.

7. **Correct the Location**:

   - If the initial answer is incorrect, refine your search to find the accurate location.
   - Search for the phrase "Scuttlehole Trailhead located at" to find more information.
   - The correct location is "Daniel Boone National Forest."

8. **Reset Password with Correct Answer**:

   - Use "Daniel Boone National Forest" as the answer to the security question.
