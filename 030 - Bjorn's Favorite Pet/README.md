## Finding the Answer

The pet's name is "Zaya." This was found in a talk given by Bjorn where he registers an account in Juice Shop with this answer to the forgotten password question. The key lesson here is to avoid using security questions that can be easily answered through basic research or reconnaissance.

## Description

This challenge highlights the importance of choosing security questions with answers that are not easily accessible through public information. It underscores the risk of using easily discoverable answers and emphasizes the need for robust security practices when setting up password recovery mechanisms. By using publicly available data to answer the security question, this challenge illustrates a common vulnerability in security setups.
