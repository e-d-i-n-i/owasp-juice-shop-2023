   - If you're using **Chrome**:
     - Open the browser's menu and go to **More Tools**.
     - Select **Developer Tools**, then switch to the **Sources** tab.

2. **Locate the JavaScript File**:

   - Refresh the page to ensure all resources are loaded.
   - In the Debugger (Firefox) or Sources (Chrome), look for a JavaScript file named `main.js`.
   - Click on the file to open it.

3. **Search for the Administration Path**:

   - Click on the **brackets** `{}` at the bottom to make the code more readable (pretty-print the code).
   - Press `Ctrl + F` (or `Cmd + F` on Mac) to open the search function.
   - Search for the term `'admin'`.

4. **Identify the Administration Page**:

   - Look for a code block containing `"path: 'administration'"`.
   - This indicates a route leading to the administration page: `/#/administration`.

5. **Attempt to Access the Page**:

   - Open a new browser tab or window and navigate to the following URL:
     ```plaintext
     http://127.0.0.1:42000/#/administration
     ```
   - If you are not logged in as an admin, the page will not load properly.

6. **Log in as an Admin**:

   - To access the administration section, log in with an administrator account.
   - Once logged in, navigate back to the `/administration` URL to view the administration page.
