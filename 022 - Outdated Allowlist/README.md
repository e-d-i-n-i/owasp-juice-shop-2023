# Outdated Allowlist Challenge ðŸª™

## Objective

The goal of this challenge is to find and redirect to a deprecated cryptocurrency address that is no longer promoted by the application, highlighting the dangers of outdated allowlists. This demonstrates how sensitive or outdated information can still be present in an application's codebase.

## Instructions

1. Go to the homepage of the OWASP Juice Shop.
2. Right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect**.
3. In the **Debugger** tab, locate the `main.js` file and copy the entire script.
4. Use an online code beautifier (e.g., [Code Beautify](https://codebeautify.org)) to make the script readable.
