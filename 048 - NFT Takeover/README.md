# üèÜ NFT Takeover Challenge

In this challenge, your goal is to take over a crypto wallet by extracting its seed phrase and finding the private key to steal cryptocurrency.

**Steps to solve the challenge:**

2. Look for clues in the customer feedback section. One of the feedbacks contains the wallet's seed phrase hidden within a `<span>` element.
3. Inspect the page and copy the seed phrase from the span element.
4. Use an Ethereum-based tool or website to extract the private key from the seed phrase.
5. Once you have the private key, visit `http://127.0.0.1:42000/#/juicy-nft`, paste the key, and click the "Authenticate" button to take over the wallet.
